Set the calendar processing with some key parameters and details
1 - Setting AutomateProcessing to AutoAccept means that meetings will be processed and accepted automatically if there are no conflicts
2 - Setting AddOrganizerToSubject to false ensures that the original subject is preserved and not replaced by the organizers’ name
3 - Setting ProcessExternalMeetingMessages to true
3 - Setting the RemovePrivateProperty to false ensures that the private flag for meeting requests is preserved (private meetings stay private)
4 - Setting DeleteComments and DeleteSubject to false is critical and ensures that your meeting invitation has a “Join” button
5 - The AdditionalResponse parameters are there to send useful information in the message back to the requester

Meeting Room Voice Configuration
If you want the meeting room to be able to make calls to the PSTN you need to enable Enterprise Voice and configure a way for the user to place calls. 
If you’re using Calling Plans from Microsoft, you need to assign the user a calling plan license. 
If, on the other hand, you’re using Direct Routing through your own SBC or that of a Service Provider, you can grant the user account a Voice Routing Policy.
